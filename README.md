# Coding-Solutions-Repository
This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from platforms such as LeetCode, NeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and more. The solutions are organized by topic and implemented in C++. The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress and provide a reference for learning and improvement.

I solve problems on platforms other than LeetCode as some problems on LeetCode require a premium account for access. When necessary, I solve similar problems available for free on other platforms.

LeetCode Problems: Solutions are organized in folders named after the LeetCode problem number.
Other Platforms: Folders are named using the LeetCode problem number indicating that it is a similar problem to the LeetCode problem.
Practice Problems: Folders with no number contain problems solved for practice.

Feel free to explore the repository to see my approach to different coding challenges and track my development in problem-solving skills.
